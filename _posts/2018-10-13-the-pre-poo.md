As we've seen in the [Max growth protocol](http://curlylab.com/haircare/max-growth-protocol/), pre-poo is the first step for a healthy hair journey. 
Pre-pooing adds an opportunity to deal with very tangled or dry hair that would get even worse if shampooed without any previous care.
However, contrary to straighter textures, curly and coily hair are very prone to breakage when manipulated dry, so product application and detangling should be done very carefully!

There's a variety of things you can do here:

* **Hot oil treatment** - Heat-up your favorite oil in the microwave for 20 seconds (to maintain its properties) and massage it into your scalp for at least 5 minutes. Mist your lengths with water and cover them with the remainder oil. The heat along with the massage helps with blood circulation in your scalp, by bringing oxygenated blood to the follicules. This may aid with hair growth besides being super relaxing! Misting the lengths before applying the oil, makes it more manageable besides adding some level of hydration to the hair shaft.

* **Conditioner + oil** - Apply your favorite oil to the scalp and massage for at least 5 minutes. Mix a moisturizing or protein-rich conditioner, depending on your needs, with oil and apply to the hair length. Similar to above, the conditioner adds slip and hydration to hair. Using the oil without heating it, ensures its full benefits and its one less step, making it easier to go through your routine.

* **Homemade recipe** - Mayonaise, honey, yogurt, eggs, mashed avocados or bananas can be mixed together in a variety of combinations that use the natural benefits of these ingredients for holistic hair care. These, however, must be very well rinsed to avoid rotting and unwanted smells in the hair.

* **Commercial remedy** - For those less comfortable with the whole DIY-concept and that want to reach for something with a coherent formulation and results, there is a plethora of treatments available at convenience stores. These can always be supplemented with other ingredients but are an easier way to make sure you add the pre-poo step into your routine.

Do you incorporate this step in your hair care routine? If so, what's your favorite way of pre-pooing?
