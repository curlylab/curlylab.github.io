Coconut oil does wonders to my dry curly (3c/4a) hair, so this time I decided to try the shampoo and conditioner “Coconut water & Aloe vera – Ultimate Blends” from Garnier. I have to say that I was very impressed with it in terms of price and quality.

Normally I would not expect much from standard supermarket shampoos and conditioners but these two are definetely worth a try. This product combines the power of coconut water with aloe vera benefits and the best of all: it does not contain parabens nor silicones! By focusing on the use of natural extracts and reducing the use of silicones to achieve the so wanted hair softness and moisture, Garnier has listened to public demand.

After using these products, my hair was very silky, soft and moisturized. Combing my hair during shower was very easy and the conditioner smells great! However, I would not recomend the use of this conditioner as a leave-in: I have tried it and my hair became very dry. Some of my friends with straight hair have tried these products and obtained similar results. So if you are looking for a cheap but efective moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, I totally recomend this one!
