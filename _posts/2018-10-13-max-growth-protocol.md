Today let's talk about all the steps to properly moisturize hair!

There are multiple times in your hair routine when you can incorporate moisture or slip to you hair:

* **Pre-poo** - This step occurs before you sham**poo** (pre-poo) your hair. Here, we want to make the washing process as easy and less damaging as possible. Applying oil to your hair and scalp not only helps with any detangling that you need to do before hopping in the shower, but also helps protect against hygral fatigue, loss of protein and from the shampoo detergents.

* **Wash & condition** - The wash process varies if you are in need of a thorough cleanse, also called clarifying, if you just want to cleanse your hair but it does not have a huge amount of buildup, or if you just need to refresh your hair. Depending on the scenario, you want to adjust which products to use, ranging from clarifying shampoos, gentler shampoos or even just conditioner. Just remember that if you use any shampoo you should follow with conditioner or deep conditioner to re-moisturize and to add slip for easier manipulation .

* **Deep condition** - This steps helps impart extra moisture or strength to your hair. Although we should deep condition hair as often as possible, it is specially important after a deep cleanse session, or if your hair went through any kind of stress, such as the use of hot tools or chemical processing.

* **Styling** - During styling we want to maximize our hair qualities, for example enhance our curl pattern, or bend it to our will, when doing a slick ponytail. For this, we may have to apply products with hold, like gels or pommades, but it is important to always have a hydrating leave-in as a base, and oil for slip and moisture retention.

Let me know which of these steps do you incorporate in your routine or what is your favorite. Tag **@curlylabofficial**, and share your success with us with the **#maxcaremaxgrowth** hashtag! We love to see your beautiful manes :)
