Although [texture](http://curlylab.com/haircare/hair-typespart1/) is the most common way to classify hair, in this post we will see how we can understand our hair better, by assessing its thickness and volume using the FIA system.

**Strand thickness**
* Fine - Thin strands that sometimes are almost translucent when held up to the light. Shed strands can be hard to see even against a contrasting background. You can also try rolling a strand between your thumb and index finger. Fine hair is difficult to feel or it feels like an ultra-fine strand of silk.

* Medium - Strands are neither fine nor coarse. When rolling a strand between your thumb and index finger, medium-thickness hair feels like a cotton thread. You can feel it, but it isn't stiff or rough. It is neither fine nor coarse.

* Coarse - Thick strands whose shed strands usually are easily identified against most backgrounds. You can also try rolling a strand between your thumb and index finger. Coarse hair feels hard and wiry. As you roll it back and forth, you may hear it.

**Volume by circumference of ponytail**
* i	- Thin hair has	a circumference of less than 2 inches (< 5 centimetres).
* ii - Normal hair has a perimeter from 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimetres).
* iii - Thick hair has a circumference of more than 4 inches (> 10 centimetres).

My hair is coarse and although I haven't officially measured it, I believe I have medium volume. 
Have you ever measured your hair volume? Did it surprise you? Let me know if you want to know mine! :*
