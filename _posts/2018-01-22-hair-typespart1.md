There are multiple systems that classify hair, and although we can easily identify it as straight, wavy, curly or coily, my favorite way of typing hair by curl pattern is using the FIA system. Not all hair is the same, an this system allow us to classify each broad type of hair with greater precision.<!--more--> Since it is more detailed, we can distinguish curls of different sizes, hair-strand thickness and overall volume:

**Texture**

Straight
* 1a - Stick-straight.
* 1b - Straight but with a slight body wave adding some volume.
* 1c - Straight with body wave and one or two visible S-waves (e.g. at nape of neck or temples).

Wavy
* 2a - Loose with stretched S-waves throughout.
* 2b - Shorter with more distinct S-waves (resembling e.g. braided damp hair).
* 2c - Distinct S-waves, some spiral curling.

Curly
* 3a - Big, loose spiral curls.
* 3b - Bouncy ringlets.
* 3c - Tight corkscrews.

Coily
* 4a - Tightly coiled S-curls.
* 4b - Z-patterned (tightly coiled, sharply angled).
* 4c - Mostly Z-patterned (tightly kinked, less definition).

[picture of hair types]

My hair is mostly a type 3c, although I have all type 3 variations (3a, 3b, 3c) in  my head.
Tighter curls  in the back, and the curls get looser in the front, mostly because I bleached my hair in 2016, but that's a story for another post! 
What's your hair texture? Are you still confused by all these systems? If so and you're curious to know, let us know and we will help you with that :)
