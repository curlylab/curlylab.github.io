Hair is composed of a protein structure called alpha-keratin that emerges from follicules in the skin or scalp.

When looked in a crosswise section, the keratin in [type 3 and 4 hair](/haircare/hair-types/) forms a ribbon-shaped structure instead of the more spherical shape of type 1 and 2 hair. The flatter the hair structure, the coilier hair gets because this shape allows more cysteines (amino acids in our hair) to bond together resulting in a bent shape that becomes coilier in form. Despite popular beliefe or deceiving looks, this different shape makes our hair more fragile, less shiny and more prone to breakage in stress points.

In addition to curl size, hair-strand thickness and overall volume, it is very useful to know what is your hair porosity to further optimize its care routine. Hair porosity relates to how the scales in each hair strand lays. Ideally, hair should be medium or normal porosity, with scales that are not too tightly closed nor excessively lifted (most often seen in chemically treated hair), as it is able to retain moisture for a reasonable amount of time. However, if the scales are lifted, the hair is of high porosity, meaning we need to take extra steps to make sure retain any moisture added, as it can easily escape. When the scales are mostly closed, the hair is considered low porosity, meaning it takes more effort to moisturize the inner layers of the strand. 

My hair is mostly low porosity, with only the front sections behaving as high porosity hair, as it is the part I have bleached earlier.

Taking everything together, the more sensitive hair types 3 and 4, with lack or excessive porosity need to follow adjusted regimens for maximal health and growth.
