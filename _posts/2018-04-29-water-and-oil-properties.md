Often times I find myself wondering how can I improve my hair health...

I started thoroughly researching for solutions when I decided to transition, until I reached a point when I became confortable with my choices and experiences. Now, after growing a head full of healthy natural hair, I want to help you do the same in a series of guides. 

Today let's talk about the properties of water-based and oil-based products!

Water-based products impart hydration into hair strands. Strands that are moisturized are supple, have more elasticity and are less prone to breakage. To achieve this, one can use water or products that have water as first ingredient, sometimes appearing in its latin form - _Aqua_. I also love products with aloe vera as their first ingredient, since it has 98.5% of water content with 75 potentially active constituents, such as vitamins, minerals and amino acids. 

However, moisture alone will not benefit your hair in the long term. How many of you have wetted your hair to quickly resolve dry-looking curls, only to have a straw-looking mess a few hours later? I know I've done this mistake too many times. That's why it is essencial to add a bit of oil to seal the moisture in. This means that the water molecules will have a harder time evaporating as they are blocked with a thin layer of oil. 
Besides acting a sealant, oils can be very useful in adding slip to our hair strands. Here, it not only helps with detangling, making it easier for any tools to glide through hair, but it also diminishes friction between the strands, avoiding "normal" and "single-stranded" knots.

Finally, just like water, oil alone may give you the appearance of healthy, shiny hair, but underneath you're still left with dehydrated hair, so the goal is to start with a clean base, add a water-based product and then the oil :)
