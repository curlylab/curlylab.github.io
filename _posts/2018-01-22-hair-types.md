There are multiple systems that classify hair, and although we can easily identify it as straight, wavy, curly or coily, my favorite way of typing hair by curl pattern is using the FIA system. Not all hair is the same, an this system allow us to classify each broad type of hair with greater precision.<!--more--> Since it is more detailed, we can distinguish curls of different sizes, hair-strand thickness and overall volume:

<!--(Table do FIA system) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair#Classification_systems-->

**Texture**

Straight
* 1a - Stick-straight.
* 1b - Straight but with a slight body wave adding some volume.
* 1c - Straight with body wave and one or two visible S-waves (e.g. at nape of neck or temples).

Wavy
* 2a - Loose with stretched S-waves throughout.
* 2b - Shorter with more distinct S-waves (resembling e.g. braided damp hair).
* 2c - Distinct S-waves, some spiral curling.

Curly
* 3a - Big, loose spiral curls.
* 3b - Bouncy ringlets.
* 3c - Tight corkscrews.

Coily
* 4a - Tightly coiled S-curls.
* 4b - Z-patterned (tightly coiled, sharply angled).
* 4c - Mostly Z-patterned (tightly kinked, less definition).

**Strand thickness**
* Fine - Thin strands that sometimes are almost translucent when held up to the light. Shed strands can be hard to see even against a contrasting background. You can also try rolling a strand between your thumb and index finger. Fine hair is difficult to feel or it feels like an ultra-fine strand of silk.

* Medium - Strands are neither fine nor coarse. When rolling a strand between your thumb and index finger, medium-thickness hair feels like a cotton thread. You can feel it, but it isn't stiff or rough. It is neither fine nor coarse.

* Coarse - Thick strands whose shed strands usually are easily identified against most backgrounds. You can also try rolling a strand between your thumb and index finger. Coarse hair feels hard and wiry. As you roll it back and forth, you may hear it.

**Volume by circumference of ponytail**
* i	- Thin hair has	a circumference of less than 2 inches (< 5 centimetres).
* ii - Normal hair has a perimeter from 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimetres).
* iii - Thick hair has a circumference of more than 4 inches (> 10 centimetres).

My hair is mostly a type 3c, although I have all type 3 variations (3a, 3b, 3c) in  my head.
Tighter curls  in the back, and the curls get larger in the front, mostly because I bleached my hair in 2016, but that's a story for another post! My hair is coarse and although I haven't officially measured it, I believe I have medium volume. 

Have you ever measured your hair volume? Did it surprise you? Let me know if you want to know mine! :*
